Chapter 3 AstroStats part2: 

Goal: Get acquainted with different distributions 


4)a)Find the pearson coefficient for two univariate data sets: Use one column of color (eg
g-r) and separate it into two sets using 'kind'. For instance make two data sets using kind = 1 and 
kind = -11. Make sure each data set has the same of N. Obviously, you wouldn't
do this in practice, but this is for you to get familiar with the various quantities.
Note: plot the two datasets against eachother and if the plot is a blobby rounded scattered mess
then more than likely uncorrelated.

b)compute the t-statistic (eqn 3.103) to determine the confidence level for how ever many degrees
of freedom that you have. You may have to google this one for more info.
 
5) a) Find the pearson coefficient r for 2 columns of data from problem 3. Spoiler alert: These are more than
likely correlated. 

b) Using eqn 3.104, find the confidence interval for 99%. This page helped a lot: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient

6) Perform the  correlation test on the two columns of data using spearmanr, pearsonr, and kendalltau.
Using the bootstrap method, try to generate plots like 3.24
