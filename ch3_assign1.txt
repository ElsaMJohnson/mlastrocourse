Chapter 3 AstroStats: 

Goal: Get acquainted with different distributions 


1)Play with different distributions using scripts in text using the stats 
package from scipy.  
-Find as many descriptive statistics (mean, mode, etc) as you can and that
are relevant to the particular distribution
-Plot each distribution as a curve and as a histogram for N=100 to 1000. 
-Try Gaussian, Binomial,  Poisson, Cauchy, Laplace. Can do more if you want.


2)Central Limit Theorem: Try producing the same figures for 3.20 and 3.21 but
for non-uniform distributions. 

3)Load my data, 'emj_data.txt', and fit a bivariate gaussian. Try to replicate 
figure 3.23. 
Use the generic scripts in snscript.py (or use your own) to read in columns 5 
and 7 use function fit_bivariate_normal() to fit the data.
You will have to tweak the plotting script portion of figure 3.23.
