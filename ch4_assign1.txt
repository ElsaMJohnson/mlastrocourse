Maximum Likelihood:
1. Suppose that out of 100 trials of a drug, 36 trials showed an effect from the drug and 64 didn't.
	a. Firstly, what kind of distribution is this?
	b. What is the likelihood of these parameters if probability p =0.5 for success?
	c. Plot likelihood for several values of p (0<p<1)
	d. What is the most likely value for p? 

Truncated gaussian:
2. Following the example on page 130 about Karpathian students derive* their MLE for the average
Karpathian IQ (mu) if.. 
	a. One Karpathian student has an IQ of 140  
	b. If 2 Karpathians have an iq of 120 and 140
* Derive here is a poor word choice because the solution isn't analytic. Use other means.


3. Use AIC method to find the best fit model on data. For data you can either use my data, data sets on
 scikit learn or generate random numbers. 
a) Fit a polynomial (1 to n orders) and exponential. Compare using AIC method.

GMM
4.a. Take a column of the previous data set or my data set and make a histogram. Find a GMM that fits
  b. Following the example on figure 4.2 create your own GMM and randomly select from it to create a 
    distribution and try to fit a GMM using a range of models. 
      i. Figure out the probabilities of data points belonging to each class.
      ii. Use AIC to find the best fit. You can use BIC as well but evidently this is a later topic.
